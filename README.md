# MAL Better Related Entries

A Chrome browser extension for [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/). The extension improves the readability of the related section for Anime and Manga by separating the entries of each relation via a line break, instead of a comma. It also adds the ability to sort the entries inside the same relation by ID and Title.
